# Slate is Dead, Long Live Slate (April 2021)

This repo fork is solely intended to support legacy projects already using Slate, since Slate itself is deprecated by Shopify (See Legacy Info section below).

## Primary Updates

### Upgraded Themekit = Vastly Faster Deploys

To take advantage of file checksums, so only changed files are uploaded/downloaded on deploy/start etc

### Removed analytics calls from CLI commands

To avoid axios errors clogging the logs

## Installation

Releases will be accessible only from tarballs on the [release page](https://github.com/kingandpartners/slate/releases/)

Go to the release page for the latest release and note the individual packages attached to the release.

Copy the links to each of the tarballs (.tgz files) and then install as normal via URL.

Since we're not changing the Shopify namespace and we're installing the updated packages from outside the NPM registry, we have to install each updated package individually.
```
npm i --save-dev [package url] [package url]

 e.g.
npm i --save-dev https://github.com/kingandpartners/slate/releases/download/v1.0.1/shopify-slate-sync-1.0.1.tgz https://github.com/kingandpartners/slate/releases/download/v1.0.1/shopify-slate-tools-1.0.1.tgz

...
```

The resulting package.json will look like
```
...

  "devDependencies": {
    "@shopify/slate-sync": "https://github.com/kingandpartners/slate/releases/download/v1.0.1-beta.0/slate-sync-1.0.1-beta.0.tgz",
    "@shopify/slate-tools": "https://github.com/kingandpartners/slate/releases/download/v1.0.1-beta.0/slate-tools-1.0.1-beta.0.tgz",

    ...
```

## Usage Notes
- Due to the way Themekit is calculating checksums, you'll note that certain files are always uploaded despite no obvious changes (e.g. `locales/en.default.json`)
  - This is because Shopify is minifying the JSON after upload, so the file on Shopify will have a different checksum than our repo version.

## Release creation

### 0. Modify dependency versions as part of PR against develop
First, modify the `@shopify/slate-sync` dependency version within `slate-tools` to be that tarball url that will be generated as part of our release. This will take the form of `https://github.com/thecitizenry/slate/releases/download/v1.0.1/shopify-slate-sync-1.0.1.tgz` where the version number is the git tag / version we are about to release.

> Explanation for above^: Since `@shopify/slate-sync` will only be referenced by its remote tarball within both `slate-tools`'s and our main Shopify codebase's package.json, the dependency graph within Node will not guarantee that our Shopify codebase's dependency is resolved first, which will result in `No matching version found for @shopify/slate-sync@1.0.1.` when attempting an npm install. This solves that issue by always referencing the tarball here, even through it won't exist until we actually cut the github release.
### 1. Merge necessary PR's to `develop`

### 2. Create a release PR from `develop` to `master` and merge

### 3. Checkout and pull master

### 4. `npm run release`
This uses Lerna lib to bump all the necessary versions (you'll be prompted to choose the next version) and creates the release tag on the repo releases page.

If necessary bump the version in each package's README.md (e.g. `## Last update (1.0.1-beta.2)`) to force Lerna to change the version for that package.

```
$ npm run release

> slate@ release /Users/johnroyall/slate-mine
> lerna version --exact && git push --follow-tags

lerna notice cli v3.11.0
lerna info current version 1.0.1-beta.1
lerna info Looking for changed packages since v1.0.0-beta.19
? Select a new version (currently 1.0.1-beta.1) Custom Version
? Enter a custom version 1.0.1-beta.2

Changes:
 - @shopify/slate-sync: 1.0.1-beta.1 => 1.0.1-beta.2
 - @shopify/slate-tools: 1.0.1-beta.1 => 1.0.1-beta.2

? Are you sure you want to create these versions? Yes
lerna info execute Skipping GitHub releases
lerna info git Pushing tags...
lerna success version finished
Everything up-to-date
```

### 5. Package the individual tarballs with `npm pack` (for any updated packages)
Run npm pack for both the `slate-tools` and `slate-sync` packages.

.eg.
```
$ pwd
/Users/johnroyall/slate-mine
$ cd packages/slate-sync
$ npm pack
npm notice
npm notice 📦  @shopify/slate-sync@1.0.1-beta.1
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
npm notice 5.3kB index.js
npm notice 115B  slate-sync.schema.js
npm notice 751B  package.json

npm notice total files:   3

```

### 6. Attach all the updated packages to the tag
Don't forget to delete the tarballs once done.

## ⚠ Slate - End of Support (January 2020)

After re-evaluating Slate and its current state, Shopify has decided to officially end support for Slate.

### Why?

With the launch of our new [section theme architecture](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/development/sections-architecture) we're taking a step back to examine our current tooling and how we can deliver the best theming experience to our theme developers.

Slate is not in line with our vision for themes moving forward and it does not solve two of the larger asks our theme developers have made:

* Local development of a Shopify theme
* Support for code versioning within themes

### I’m a theme developer that is using Slate. What should I do now?

Slate was built upon [Theme Kit](https://github.com/Shopify/themekit) as an opinionated way to setup up a Shopify theme build. Shopify will continue to actively maintain and support the growth of Theme Kit through the open-source community.

You can continue using Slate the way you have been. While we will not be maintaining it any longer, you can still fork the repo to suit your own needs.
